I am currently a Data Scientist on the conversational AI team at The Home Depot. Previously, I was a Data Scientist at Black Hills Corporation where I built large scale Bayesian/probabilistic forecasting tools and a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Arkansas. Generally, my main interest is in using probability theory and statistical or machine learning methods to improve decision making in dynamical systems. I am particular I am interested in decision theory, stochastic processes, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian probability theory.  

I wrote my Master's thesis on {{< staticref "uploads/SI_for_HMM.pdf" "newtab" >}}Sequential Monte Carlo Methods for Hidden Markov Models{{< /staticref >}}.

Here is a letter Kurt Vonnegut wrote to his daughter, Nanno, from the book Kurt Vonnegut: Letters.

<p style="text-align: center;">
    Dear Old Nanno -- 
        That was a keen letter -- and you don't have to write too many of those. It's just nice to know that there will be more than just black velvet silence out there, that a pleasant and interesting letter will drift in from time to time.
        You're learning now that you do not inhabit a solid, reliable social structure -- that the older people around you are worried, moody, goofy human beings who themselves were little kids only a few days ago. So home can fall apart and schools can fall apart , usually for childish reasons -- and what have you got? A space wanderer named Nan.
        And that's O.K. I'm a space wanderer named Kurt, and Jane's a space wanderer named Jane, and so on. When things go well for days on end, it is an hilarious accident.
        You are dismayed at having lost a year, maybe, because the school fell apart. Well -- I feel as though I've lost the years since Slaughterhouse-Five was published, but that's malarky. Those years weren't lost. They simply weren't the way I'd planned them. Neither was the year in which Jim had to stay motionless in bed while he got over TB. Neither was the year in which Mark went crazy, then put himself together again. Those years were adventures. Planned years are not.
