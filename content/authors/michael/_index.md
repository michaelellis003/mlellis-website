I am currently a Data Scientist on the conversational AI team at The Home Depot. Previously, I was a Data Scientist at Black Hills Corporation where I built large scale Bayesian/probabilistic forecasting tools and a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Arkansas. Generally, my main interest is in using probability theory and statistical or machine learning methods to improve decision making in dynamical systems. In particular I am interested in decision theory, stochastic processes, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian probability theory.  

I wrote my Master's thesis on {{< staticref "uploads/SI_for_HMM.pdf" "newtab" >}}Sequential Monte Carlo Methods for Hidden Markov Models{{< /staticref >}}.
